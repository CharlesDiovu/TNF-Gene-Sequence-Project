# TNF Gene Analysis

This repository contains various bioinformatics analyses performed on the TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor) gene. Below are the detailed steps and results of each process:

## 1. Viewing TNF Sequence

The TNF gene sequence was highlighted within a DNA sequence track, indicating its specific location and nucleotide composition for further analysis.

## 2. Translating TNF into Amino Acids
The TNF gene was translated into its corresponding amino acid sequence, starting with Methionine (M) and including various other amino acids like Serine (S), Arginine (R), and Glutamic acid (E).

## 3. ORF Analysis
The Open Reading Frame (ORF) analysis identified multiple ORFs within the TNF gene sequence. The longest ORF spans positions 178 to 606, translating into 143 amino acids. Other notable ORFs include:
- Positions 450 to 587 (46 amino acids)
- Positions 470 to 610 (47 amino acids)
- Positions 659 to 781 (41 amino acids)
- Positions 756 to 923 (56 amino acids)

## 4. Sequence Composition Analysis
The sequence composition analysis of the TNF gene revealed the distribution of nucleotides as follows:
- Adenine (A): 58%
- Thymine (T)/Guanine (G): 29%
- Cytosine (C): 13%

## 5. Transcription Factor Analysis
The transcription factor analysis revealed several key binding sites within the TNF gene. Notable transcription factors include NF-κB, AP-1, and C/EBPβ, which are crucial for regulating TNF gene expression and play significant roles in immune response and inflammation.

## 6. Functional Motifs Analysis
Two significant motifs were identified within the TNF gene:
- Motif 1: E-value of 2.4e-005, found in 58 sites, 38 nucleotides long, with a prominent presence of adenine (A) and thymine (T) bases.
- Motif 2: E-value of 1.0e-003, found in 32 sites, 38 nucleotides long, with a more varied nucleotide distribution.

## 7. Coding/Non-Coding Regions Analysis
The GENSCAN analysis predicted several coding and non-coding regions within the TNF gene. Key regions include:
- First gene: Positions 221 to 406 (186 base pairs)
- Intron: Positions 1013 to 1058
- Intron: Positions 1246 to 1293
- Final exon: Positions 1595 to 2016 (422 base pairs)
- Polyadenylation signal at the end of the sequence

## 8. Converting TNF from FASTA to PHYLIP Format
The TNF gene sequence was converted from FASTA format to PHYLIP format, aligning the sequences into a fixed-width field suitable for phylogenetic analysis.
